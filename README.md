# NEAP Stack Web Server Configuration Files
I encountered some issues when setting up the NEAP stack server for the database project with the help of [this blog](http://mherman.org/blog/2015/02/12/postgresql-and-nodejs/).
This is a folder that shows some of my way to fix some common issue when setting up the environment.
#Potential issues and fixes:
Some command can that has an error can be fixed with adding a <code>sudo</code> in the front.

The file that I modified my self are:
- **package.json** for the starting command.
- /models folder.
- /models/database.js is copied from the website and modified on my own since I experience some hard time connecting to the database.
- README.md is just a documentation guidance.
